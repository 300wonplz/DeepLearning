# Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

### I used MNIST datasets.

* GAN.ipynb
  * Simple Generative Adversarial Networks using just one hidden layer

* GAN_v2.ipynb
  * Just add specific noise to above simple Generative Adversarial Networks to make specific Number

* DCGAN.ipynb
  * Generative Adversarial Networks with Convolutional Neural Networks.
